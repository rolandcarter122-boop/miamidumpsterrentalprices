                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px; font-size: larger; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;">What is the most common mistake people make that leads to unexpected charges?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The most frequent error is improper loading of heavy materials. Debris like dirt, concrete, or asphalt is extremely heavy and must be in its own dedicated heavy debris dumpster in #State. Mixing a large amount of these materials with lighter trash is the number one cause of costly overweight fees.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How do you calculate the final weight of my debris?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">All of our trucks are required to go to a certified weigh station at the disposal facility. They weigh the truck when it's full (gross weight) and again after it's been emptied (tare weight). The difference between these two numbers is the exact, certified weight of your disposed material, a copy of which is available to you.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">What is a "trip fee" and how do I avoid it?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">A trip fee is a charge incurred if our driver arrives for a scheduled delivery or pickup and cannot complete the service due to an obstacle, like a parked car blocking the placement area. You can avoid it by ensuring the entire access path is clear and unobstructed on your service day.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Can the dumpster be placed on a city street in front of my business?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">In most municipalities, placing a roll off dumpster bin on a public street requires a permit from the city's department of public works or a similar entity. You, as the renter, are typically responsible for securing this permit before we can schedule the delivery.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">I have a lot of scrap metal. Do you pay for it or is there still a hauling fee?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">While we do not purchase scrap metal directly, we can provide a dedicated roll off container for it. Depending on the volume and current market rates for metal, we can often offer a significantly reduced hauling fee or, in some cases, a no-cost haul for clean-loaded, high-value scrap. Please call us to discuss your specific material.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">For a wedding at a historic venue, how do you protect the property?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We take property protection very seriously. The professional standard is to have the client or venue provide wooden planks or sheets of plywood to be placed on the ground before the dumpster is delivered. This creates a simple but effective barrier to protect any sensitive surfaces.</p>
